![Advanced Face Recognition](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0555863-a7ce-4bd8-b7ac-19e242c7efc0)

Welcome to the **Advanced Face Recognition** project! This project is designed to give you practical experience in building a powerful face detection system using the YOLOv10 model. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, you'll find valuable insights and skills to enhance your machine learning toolkit.

## ðŸš€ What You'll Learn:

- **Capture Your Own Dataset**: Gain hands-on experience by collecting and using your own images as primary data for the model.
- **Semi-Automated Labeling**: Implement a semi-automated labeling system using a pre-trained face detection model to streamline your data preparation process.
- **Data Augmentation**: Expand and enhance your dataset by learning various data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- **Train and Deploy YOLOv10**: Learn the process of training and deploying the state-of-the-art YOLOv10 model, known for its speed, accuracy, and efficiency.
